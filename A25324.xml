            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have rceiv'd ſo many Libels and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pamphlets from you; that I am both aſham'd of troubling you any farther, and weary of Reading ſo many words with ſo little ſenſe or common honeſty. But my great grief is to find it ſo much the humor to leſſen the Credit and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Authority, and by weakning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in alienating mens hearts from it; to cut the Graſs from underneath our own feet: and whilſt the Enemy is puſhing ſore at us, our ſelves to ſhake, if not remove the Foundations whereon we ſtand. And in the midſt of this wilful mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, no wound ſeems to me ſo envenom'd and mortal, as that which pierces the Soul and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Nation, the bitter words wherewith the Church is dayly ſlander'd. Is it a time to ſtrive among our ſelves for Reformation, when Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is at the Gates? Is it a time to divide and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to pull and tear one another, juſt when the common Enemy is upon our backs? To mind our defence leaſt, when he is moſt at leiſure to Aſſault us? It muſt certainly be the Gall of bitterneſs, that ſhall diſturb and diſtract us at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66183:3"/>
Amongſt other ungracious Libels againſt the Church, there is one called <hi>Omnia Comeſta à Bello.</hi> The Author intended <hi>Belo:</hi> but hapned to be more right then he was aware of. For the late unhappy Times plainly ſhew what the iſſues of War are like to be. Then were the Rich and Wealthy the only marks of Violence and Oppreſſion; none but the Profligate and thoſe that delighted in troubl'd wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters became Rich: then the worſt of events befel us, if the Proverb ſays true; for Beggars were ſet on Thrones and mounted on Horsback, whilſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces went on Foot. And if we conſider the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of this Book, it was firſt Printed at the beinning of the Rebellion, to Uſher in the Covenant, and ſo acceſſary, as much as ſuch a poor ſpiteful Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet could be, to all the bloud-ſhed and wickedneſs that then follow'd. God be thanked the memory of thoſe licentious days, when no man could ſay, ought was his, is by woful experience ſo freſh now upon the minds of thouſands, that without moſt fatal Infatuation, it will be impoſſible to be delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the ſame ſnare again. And yet what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours there are to deſtroy us with the grievous wounds of Friends, and under pretence of Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation overwhelm us once more with the ſame Confuſion! What is Liberty, when the multitude is made judg of it, but an Inundation of Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and letting the wildneſs of Corrupt Nature looſe to all extravagance. And yet what courting
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66183:3"/>of the people at this day to take the matter into their own hands! Though, God knows, it is not that theſe Incendiaries care for the people: but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the reigns of Government muſt be placed in ſome hands, they hope by getting them looſe, to catch hold of them themſelves. And as this is evidently the courſe the Pope or Devil himſelf wou'd adviſe to deſtroy us by, Diviſions: ſo I ſhall ſhew you in the concluſion that this is their adviſe, and that they do work together with the diſturbers of our Peace, and principally with thoſe that ſtrike at our Church.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he charges the impoveriſhing the Nation, ruin of Trade, and general Conſumption of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Setlement and Content, which, as he ſays, has brought the Nation to a mere Anatomy; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pride, Luxury and Oppreſſion of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. To which may eaſily be anſwer'd. 1. That the firſt aſſertion is falſe. For never was there more mony in the Nation, and if it be not ſo equally divided, the Gentry and Nobility living ſo much at <hi>London,</hi> are the great cauſe of it. As for Trade it never run ſo high as of late years, of which, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is ſo evident a judg, that I can only won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the Confidence of the contrary declaration. But then where the Conſumption of Comfort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> lyes, who can tell? I am ſure if a Prince deteſting Bloud-ſhed and Oppreſſion, and for fear of being hard upon his people, ſuffering his Prerogative to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66183:4"/>run lower than ever any Kings or Queens of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did before him, would be a Comfort, we have it in the higheſt degree. If the Clergy have contributed to this Conſumption, let them ſhew the man, and he ſhall be puniſht. But I ſee none but the envious, and them that are given to change, diſcontented: and how you will pleaſe them, I cannot tell. And I fear the Nation is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like <hi>Jeſhurun,</hi> than any of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean Kine, if we obſerve truly. Nay but the pride of the Prelates has done this thing, which indeed is not done. It muſt be a beggarly pride in many of them, if they are proud: and that can do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to none but to themſelves. However I would have this Learned Author ſhew who they are. For general reflections are the moſt unjuſt; and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the moſt Unchriſtian proceeding in the World. The Innocent as well as Guilty are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, and know not how to kelp themſelves. But Luxury indeed is the waſting Vice, and I would it were not ſo much in faſhion as it is. However there are not many Biſhops that have wherewithal, and thoſe few that have, are, I make no doubt, ready to give an account, to the ſhame of their Accuſers. Where the Oppreſſion lyes, that I am to ſeek: unleſs be ſuch, to puniſh injuſtice as wrongful dealing. But of theſe particulars more hereafter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. in the next Query there is as much falſhood and ignorance put together, as well could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66183:4"/>in ſo few terms. He tells you that all the Reform'd Churches in <hi>Europe</hi> caſt off Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy with Popery, and why did not <hi>England? England</hi> did not do it, becauſe it has been the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and conſtant Church-Government for the firſt fifteen hundred years, deriv'd from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles by as Authentick Teſtimony as any part of our Religion. <hi>England</hi> did not do it, becauſe it is an Order that ſtands moſt in the Popes light, and which therefore <hi>Rome</hi> has always oppos'd, moſt eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and moſt injuriouſly by exempt juriſdictions, whereby to have creatures more immediately depending upon <hi>Rome,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church is broken, and its Antient Conſtitutions and Canons violated. And I wiſh this Rag of Popery were removed from us. But laſtly, <hi>England</hi> did not do it, becauſe many of the Reformed Churches did not do it, as <hi>Sueden, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> the Proteſtant Church in <hi>Poland,</hi> the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Switzers,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> beſides the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many that did it, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd it to be out of pure neceſſity, and the learnedſt men among them have ever approved Epiſcopal Government, and the beſt, if not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, when it could be had.</p>
            <p>The third Query is, Why all this waſte? Why not ſold and given to the poor? The Biſhops ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 2.3.4.5.6.7.8. thouſand pounds <hi>per ann.</hi> a man. Had he ſaid 2.3.4.5.6.7.8. hundred pounds
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66183:5"/>a year, he had come nearer the truth. For ſo it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with moſt of them: except ſome very few, the beſt of which come hardly up to four. But it is a <hi>Judas</hi> Query, and ſo I leave St. <hi>John</hi> to explain it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth is ſoon anſwer'd, Whether other Nations without Biſhops have ſucceeded in any particular, better than <hi>England</hi> with Biſhops: let the World judg. And had this Author been endow'd with as much knowledg and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he is with Malice and Covetouſneſs, he would nver have put a queſtion ſo diſadvantagious for his purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth and laſt Query, is begging the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion upon a falſe ſuppoſition: as you will ſee by what follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> his Queries are done, he comes to prove his Aſſertions: which he does by the ſame Arguments that will Eſtabliſh Anarchy for a Law, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all Government.</p>
            <p>He tells you the Biſhops keep Chaplains: and I believe as eminent for Learning and Piety have come out of that Rank, as from any places what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. But their ſeveral Officers keeping Courts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What, would he have juriſdictions look after them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? or rather would he have the Clergy be left to the wide World without Laws and Authority to protect them. Had this Author as much concern for the next World, as he has for this, he would then think, that to honour God with our ſubſtance, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66183:5"/>to adorn his worſhip with a grateful ſhare of what he has bleft us with, might be of as much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us, under the diſpenſation of Providence as other layings out; and that the Judges of the Land with the innumerable Officers and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences upon the Executive part of the Juſtice of this Nation, even to the Conſtables and Overſeers of the Poor, might as well be reckoned a burden, becauſe their Gains in a full Computation are ten times more than the Clergies; and yet I hope no man in his ſenſes can think it poſſible for us to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſt without ſuch a Conſtitution. If he will num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Pariſhes, let him Compute what is gathered for the Poor in all the Pariſhes of <hi>England;</hi> and ſee what a prodigious ſum is ſpent to maintain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in idleneſs. But he reckons and computes at ſo ſtrange a rate, as if nothing were to be done to right the Church, as if its Officers were to live upon the Air, and that whatever were received, went into a great Gulf never to return by procuring the Neceſſaries of Nature, Meat, Drink, and Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by providing for their Families, and if they provide not for the Poor above any other ſort of men, let others take their Office. Now if unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and wilful men have ſuffered by Cenſures for reſiſting the Laws: why are not Thieves, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Murderers as well pittied for their loſſes. For where a Law may be obeyed with the ſame Liberty of Conſcience, as for pretence it is broken,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66183:6"/>that Offender is as unjuſtifiable as a Thief and a Robber. That this is the Caſe with all Diſſenters is plain from the Statute, which allows Meetings to ſuch a number. And yet how little diſturbance do even the greateſt Offenders in this kind meet with? But you ſay men are Proſecuted for three pences and ſix pences: more Knaves they, that will Cheat and put to trouble their Neighbours for ſo ſlight a ſum, by with-holding anothers right.</p>
            <p>The vaſt ſums of mony the Biſhops, Deans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> heaped up at the Kings coming in, is a great Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore to him. And that the evil Eye of <hi>Judas</hi> may manifeſtly appear, he tells you a grievance. Thoſe that bought Church-Lands are undone: if he durſt, he would ſay Crown-Lands too. So here is the Caſe, Our Progenitors out of a juſt reſentment of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gave many Endowments to the Church for the more Comfortable and Honorable maintenance of thoſe that Miniſtred in it, leſt the Service of God ſhould become vile in the Eyes of the people, if he ſhould ſtill be Worſhipped in Dens and Caves, while the Profeſſors of his Worſhip dwelt in ſtately Palaces and fared plentifully. It is a ſign we will not acknowledg the hand that gave it, if we grudg a grateful return. But in comes an uſurped power, by means of an execrable Rebellion, and divides the ſpoil of Church and Crown Lands, Gods and the Kings Inheritance: and when it pleaſes God to reſtore the right again, it muſt be Oppreſſion to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66183:6"/>turn theſe young <hi>Ahabs</hi> out of their Sacrilegious and Traiterous Poſſeſſions. Neither was this envyed ſum, which the Church got, near of that value this Author would have it; and what Charges were upon it, let any judg, when they that came in, had for many years before been ſtript naked for their Loyalty, Cathedrals pulled down or let fall, Houſes waſted and ruined, Dilapidations to a prodigious Charge: and yet if the Government had taken a more narrow inſpection, perchance it might have been better. Still <hi>Judas</hi> proceeds, why all this coſt? What have we for it? You have a ſplendid Church ſuitable to the proſperity God has bleſſed us with, the wonder and rejoycing of all our Friends abroad, and the envy of <hi>Rome</hi> and its adherents, and ſuch as work under a Cloak for Popery here at home. You have a Learned, Orthodox and a Godly Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, ſuch as are not afraid to ſpeak with their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the Gate, but challenge either ſingle or in a body the whole Herd of Sectary-Miniſters, to ſee if they can anſwer them one word of a thouſand. If they have colour of truth, why do they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a free Synod? Why do they not ſeek Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? If they are ſo Sober, why do they go Drunk home ten or twenty Teachers of them every Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night, after they have ended their Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? I hear no ſuch thing of the Conforming Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: and if they know any ſuch, let them prove it, and he ſhall be caſt out. But we can prove this of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66183:7"/>a greater number of theirs, than has yet been named, even within the Walls of <hi>London,</hi> and make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that part of their Congregations know of it.</p>
            <p>But I am ſick of this ſtuff, full of nothing beſides railing falſe ſuggeſtions and upholding ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſobedience: ſo that I am reſolved no longer to anſwer a Fool according to his folly, leſt I ſhould become ſuch another. Only this let me ſay, that all he urges, were it as true as it is falſe, amounts to no more, than what the ſeveral Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, he quotes at the end, do amount unto, which is, That the proſperity of this World is a great ſnare, and that the Church as well as other Bodies, is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to abuſe it. And therefore great care ought to be taken, to reform and moderate the manners of ſuch as are intruſted with the Wealth or Power of the Church. And in Gods name, let the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny be made to heal the broken, and purge out the corrupt. But to cut off the thing abuſed with him that does abuſe it, the Office with him that is entruſted with it, is neither Sober, Juſt nor Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal. And whenever it was ſo done, you will find it in all Ages to have been done, in a tumultuous and raſh way, and by ſuch diſorders as have cut off the Juſt with the Unjuſt, when it has ſucceeded well to none but the violent. So that for the ſins of the people ſuch things may come to paſs: but I beſeech you never let it be impoſed upon us, as a prudent or juſtifiable proceeding.</p>
